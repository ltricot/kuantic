# Mobility Hackathon, organized by Valeo and Quantic
We are analysing drives to find out patterns.
We use open data from paris traffic to find out patterns in daily traffic depending on the period of the year.
We cross reference these trajectories to the traffic of Paris to compute the time wasted in traffic.
And we finally consider several reorderings to optimize those drives.
